treat others how you want to be treated
always stand up to shake someone's hand
marry someone who looks sexy while disappointed
watch a sunrise at least once a day
the most amazing things that can happen to a human being will happen to you, if you just lower your expectations
success is 1% inspiration, 98% perspiration, and 2% attention to detail
you can tell a lot about a person from his biography
if you love something, set it free; unless it's a tiger
if you're ever in a jam, a crayon scrunched up under your nose makes a good pretend mustache
when life gives you lemonade, make lemons; life will be all like "what?!"
